<h2>German luxury cars are considered to be the finest engineered cars on the planet. Recently, Germany's "Big Three" (BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi)<br>
   have been the highest selling luxury cars in the auto industry. This may surprise many people because they are some of the most expensive cars in the market,<br>
   but as "jgoods" at cargurus.com said: "The reason for this German luxo boom is simple: They make better cars." German car makers are famous for their engineering<br>
    skills, manufacturing expertise, and are also known for their incredible styling and performance..</h2>
