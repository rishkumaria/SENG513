  <h3>If you love speed, then the 1960s and 1970s was a great time to be alive.
    This era of power created some of the rarest muscle cars packing<br>
     giant torque-rich V-8s. and other regulations would tame muscle cars in the 1980s,
      but these aging beasts of the road still come with some <br>
       surprising stories as well as some surprising horsepower.</h3>
